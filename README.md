2023.12.23 bread.go v0.0

This is my first ever published code in github. This is also a very short experiment in golang.

In short, this is a sourdough bread recipe which I learned and perfected during the funny years' lockdown (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic). This works for me 100% of the time, as I discovered that bread is very sensitive to the amoutn of water, therefore the crucial measure is the water/solid ratio. This ratio however, is a function of the type of flour (which is crazy btw). You are free to replace Dinkel with normal wheat or other types of flour, except gluten free, that will NOT work. But I digress. I needed a simple calculator with which I would feed the amount of starter and it would spit out the amount of water I needed against 1 kg flour. If used in the right proportions, you will get enough quantity for two ~850-900g bread loafs.

Now, in it's current iteration it is not a comprehensive recipe, this means it will not teach you how to mix, shape, score, bake, etc. Maybe in the future I will add more steps, and even some pictures.
